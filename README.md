># SagaFlix - A Netflix Clone

+ SagaFlix - A Netflix Clone, made for the [Digital Innovation One](https://digitalinnovation.one/) BootCamp.
+ These are some of my favorite movies, so I decided to change the initial idea presented during the bootcamp to Sagas and Franchises Movies. I added a .gif in the front page, I also added a few other carousels and a footer.
