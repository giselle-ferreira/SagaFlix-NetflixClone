># SagaFlix - A Netflix Clone

+ SagaFlix - A Netflix Clone, for the FrontEnd [Digital Innovation One](https://digitalinnovation.one/) BootCamp.
+ These are some of my favorite movies, so I decided to change the initial idea presented during the bootcamp, which was with the original idea of Netflix, to Sagas and Franchises Movies. I added the video in the front page, as well as a volume control, since the I put the video in "autoplay" and "loop". I also added a few other carousels and a footer.
